# LIT

Written in Python 2 in 2016 for a Senior Capstone project. My first ever Python project (as you can tell by awful incosistent styling).

The responsbility was to gather places from FourSquare and Google Maps, look them up on Yelp and scrape their attributes. 
Then use those attributes in a knn machine learning algorithm.
The data was persisted in MongoDB.
